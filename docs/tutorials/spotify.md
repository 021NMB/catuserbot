4. On the next page, you'll see your new app's Client ID and Client Secret. These are the credentials that your bot will use to access the Spotify API. Copy these credentials and save them in your bot's configuration file as environment variables with the following names:

    - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
    - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

## ã€£ Setting up Spotify integration with the bot

1. After starting your bot, go to your bot log group in Telegram and type `.spsetup`. This command will generate a message with a link.

3. Log in to your Spotify account if you haven't already. Then, click the "Agree" button to give your bot permission to access your Spotify account.

4. After granting permission, you will be redirected to a blank page, Copy the URL of this page.

5. Go back to your bot log group in Telegram and paste the URL you just copied as a reply to the `.spsetup` message. The bot will use this URL to authenticate with Spotify.
